# wire_bower_list

requirements:
npm >= 6.14 pr yarn >= 1.22.19
node >= 18.6.0

from te root folder run this commands:
yarn install ( install dependencies )
yarn start ( run app )
yarn test ( run unit tests )

- I had to replace 'owner' with something different as 'owner' field is not provided by API anymore , so I took 'repository_url' instead.
